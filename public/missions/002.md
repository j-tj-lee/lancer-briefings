# Mission // #002
## Coming Storm
# Goals
- Reach the airfield and prepare the area for a hot extract.
  - This goes without saying, but the fewer enemies that are on-site during extraction, the better.

# Stakes
- None.

# Reserves
- Fortification supplies scavenged from the airfield en route to the hangar.
  - 6 sets of sandbags (appropriate for small mechs)
  - 2 blocks of compressed scrap (appropriate for medium mechs)
